# Swaglyrics-discord-bot
A implementation of swaglyrics into discord bot

# Usage

Simply type `$swaglyrics` and let the magic happens!

# Restrictions

Spotify needs to be connected with discord, status in "Settings -> Connections -> Spotify -> Display Spotify as your status" needs to be turned on and for now, you can't have anything that overlays status (ex. Playing game which does that)
